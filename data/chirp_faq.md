# Bird Care FAQ

## Nutrition & Feeding

### What should I feed my pet bird?

Diet varies by species. Parrots need a base of high-quality pellets (70-80%), supplemented with fresh vegetables, fruits, and limited seeds. Finches and canaries require a mix of seeds, pellets, and fresh foods. Seed-only diets are nutritionally inadequate for most birds and lead to health problems. Research your specific species' dietary needs.

### How often should I feed my bird?

Most birds should have fresh food and water provided daily. Remove uneaten fresh foods after a few hours to prevent spoilage. Pellets and seeds can remain in the cage longer but should be refreshed daily. Some birds, especially smaller species, have high metabolisms and need constant access to food.

### What fruits and vegetables are safe for birds?

Safe options include leafy greens (kale, spinach, romaine), carrots, bell peppers, broccoli, sweet potatoes, apples (no seeds), berries, bananas, and melons. Introduce new foods gradually. Avoid avocado, chocolate, caffeine, alcohol, and high-salt or high-fat foods. Remove pits and seeds from fruits that contain cyanide (apples, cherries, peaches).

### What foods are toxic to birds?

Never feed birds avocado (contains persin, which is fatal), chocolate, caffeine, alcohol, onions, garlic, high-salt foods, mushrooms, fruit pits/apple seeds (contain cyanide), rhubarb, raw beans, and xylitol (artificial sweetener). Also avoid fatty, sugary, or processed human foods. When in doubt, research before offering new foods.

### Should I give my bird vitamin supplements?

Birds on a varied, balanced diet of quality pellets and fresh foods typically don't need supplements. Excessive vitamins, especially fat-soluble ones, can cause toxicity. Consult an avian veterinarian before adding supplements. Exceptions may include breeding birds, ill birds, or those on limited diets, which may benefit from specific supplements under veterinary guidance.

### How much water does my bird need?

Fresh, clean water should be available at all times. Change water at least once daily, more often if it becomes contaminated with food or droppings. Some birds prefer drinking from water bottles, while others prefer shallow dishes. Ensure water containers are cleaned regularly to prevent bacterial growth.

### Can birds eat from my plate?

While sharing appropriate foods occasionally is fine, avoid feeding birds directly from your mouth (risk of bacteria transfer) or regularly from your plate (human food often contains salt, fat, and spices unsuitable for birds). Stick to offering bird-safe foods in appropriate portions from a separate dish.

### How do I transition my bird to a healthier diet?

Change diets gradually over 2-4 weeks. Mix new foods with familiar ones, gradually increasing the proportion of new foods. Offer new foods in the morning when birds are hungriest. Try different presentations (chopped, grated, whole) and temperatures. Some birds learn by example, so "eat" the new food yourself (pretend if necessary) to show it's safe.

## Health & Veterinary Care

### How often should my bird see a vet?

New birds should have an initial check-up within a week of acquisition. Healthy adult birds need annual exams with an avian-certified veterinarian. Birds hide illness effectively, so regular preventive care is crucial. Older birds (varies by species) may benefit from semi-annual check-ups. Always seek immediate care for concerning symptoms.

### What are signs my bird is sick?

Watch for changes in droppings (consistency, color, frequency), decreased appetite, increased sleeping, fluffed feathers, tail bobbing, labored breathing, discharge from eyes/nares, changes in vocalization, weight loss, balance issues, or behavior changes. Birds hide illness as a survival mechanism, so subtle changes can indicate serious problems requiring immediate veterinary attention.

### How do I find an avian veterinarian?

Look for vets certified by the Association of Avian Veterinarians or with special interest in birds. Ask local bird clubs, pet stores, or breeders for recommendations. Call veterinary offices and ask about their experience with your bird species. Establish a relationship before emergencies occur, as not all vets treat birds.

### How can I prevent common bird diseases?

Maintain proper nutrition, hygiene, and housing. Quarantine new birds for 30-45 days before introducing them to existing birds. Avoid exposure to drafts, fumes, and temperature extremes. Clean cages, toys, and food/water containers regularly. Recognize early signs of illness. Schedule regular veterinary check-ups. Minimize stress through proper socialization and environmental enrichment.

### How do I trim my bird's nails and beak?

Most birds need professional nail and beak trims by an avian veterinarian or experienced groomer. Frequency varies by species and individual. Providing appropriate perches of varying diameters and textures (concrete, natural wood) helps naturally wear down nails and beaks. Never attempt to trim a bird's flight feathers without proper training.

### Should I clip my bird's wings?

This is a personal decision balancing safety and natural behavior. Clipped birds are less likely to fly away or injure themselves flying into windows/hazards but have reduced exercise and natural behavior opportunities. If clipping, have it done professionally by an avian vet or experienced groomer. Some species rely more heavily on flight for physical and psychological well-being.

### How do I administer medication to my bird?

Follow veterinary instructions precisely. Most liquid medications can be administered directly into the beak using a syringe (without needle) or mixed with a small amount of favorite food (if approved by your vet). Never force a struggling bird as this can cause aspiration or injury. Ask your vet for a demonstration and alternative methods if needed.

### How do I check my bird's weight?

Regular weighing helps detect health problems early. Use a digital scale that measures in grams. Weigh at the same time of day (preferably morning before feeding) for consistency. Train your bird to step onto the scale or weigh it in a small container (subtract the container weight). Record weights to establish a baseline and track trends.

## Behavior & Training

### How do I tame a new or frightened bird?

Progress at the bird's pace. Start by sitting quietly near the cage, talking softly. Gradually introduce your hand in the cage without attempting to touch the bird. Offer treats from your hand. Once comfortable, try target training with a stick before attempting handling. Never grab or force interaction. Some birds may take weeks or months to trust.

### How do I teach my bird to step up?

Present your finger or a perch horizontally against the bird's lower chest while giving a consistent verbal cue like "step up." Apply gentle pressure if needed. Reward success with praise or treats. Practice at the bird's eye level initially, then gradually vary heights and locations. If the bird bites, avoid reacting negatively; instead, analyze what triggered the behavior.

### Why does my bird scream or make loud noises?

Birds vocalize for communication, territorial marking, flock calling, attention-seeking, or expressing emotions. Excessive screaming may indicate boredom, insufficient attention, or learned behavior. Address by providing environmental enrichment, consistent daily routine, appropriate attention (not during screaming), and positive reinforcement of quiet behavior. Some species are naturally louder than others.

### How do I stop my bird from biting?

Identify and address triggers (fear, territoriality, hormonal behavior, learned response). Avoid punishment, which damages trust. Use positive reinforcement for gentle behavior. Respect body language indicating discomfort. For hormonal biting, modify diet, reduce daylight hours, and limit nest-like environments. Consistent handling techniques and training help establish boundaries.

### How much sleep does my bird need?

Most birds need 10-12 hours of uninterrupted darkness and quiet for proper sleep. Cover the cage or place in a quiet room at night. Insufficient sleep can lead to behavioral issues, weakened immunity, and stress. Maintain a consistent sleep schedule. Some species, particularly those from equatorial regions, may need more consistent day/night cycles.

### How do I provide mental stimulation for my bird?

Rotate toys weekly to maintain interest. Provide foraging opportunities (hidden treats, puzzle toys). Offer varied textures and materials for chewing and exploration. Use training sessions for mental exercise. Allow supervised out-of-cage time in a safe environment. Some birds enjoy music, nature sounds, or bird-safe videos when alone.

### Can I teach my bird to talk?

Speech capability varies by species. African greys, Amazon parrots, and mynah birds are among the best talkers. Start with simple, frequently repeated words in a clear, enthusiastic voice. Associate words with activities or objects. Not all individuals will talk regardless of species. Focus on interaction and bonding rather than speech expectations.

### How do I introduce a new bird to my existing bird?

Quarantine the new bird for 30-45 days to prevent disease transmission. After quarantine, place cages within visual range but not too close. Gradually move cages closer over weeks. Supervise initial interactions in neutral territory (not in either bird's cage). Watch body language carefully and separate if there's aggression. Some birds may never bond but can live peacefully in separate cages.

## Housing & Environment

### What size cage does my bird need?

Larger is always better. The minimum cage should allow the bird to fully extend its wings without touching the sides and have enough height for tail clearance. For reference: Budgies/canaries need at least 18"x18"x18", cockatiels 20"x20"x24", Amazon parrots 36"x24"x36". Bar spacing should prevent head from fitting through (varies by species).

### Where should I place my bird's cage?

Place in a room where the family spends time but away from drafts, direct sunlight, kitchens (cooking fumes are toxic), and windows that create temperature fluctuations. Avoid placing against walls shared with bathrooms (humidity changes). Position at least one side against a wall to provide security. Ensure the location is free from predator exposure (cats, dogs).

### What types of perches should I provide?

Offer various diameters and textures to exercise feet and prevent pressure sores. Natural, untreated branches from bird-safe trees (apple, aspen, maple) provide irregular surfaces. Avoid sandpaper perches, which can cause abrasions. Position perches at different heights, ensuring food and water remain uncontaminated by droppings. Replace worn or soiled perches promptly.

### How often should I clean my bird's cage?

Daily: Change paper liner, clean food and water containers, remove obvious waste. Weekly: Wipe down perches and cage bars, replace toys as needed. Monthly: Deep clean the entire cage with bird-safe disinfectant (rinse thoroughly and dry completely before returning bird). Adjust frequency based on cage size, number of birds, and messiness of species.

### What toys are safe for birds?

Choose toys appropriate for your bird's size and chewing habits. Safe materials include untreated wood, vegetable-tanned leather, stainless steel, nickel-plated chains (for larger birds), cotton or sisal rope (monitor for fraying), and hard plastic. Avoid zinc, lead, copper, treated woods, small parts that could be swallowed, and strings that could entangle.

### Do birds need UV light?

Yes, birds need UVA light for color perception and behavioral regulation, and UVB for vitamin D3 synthesis (essential for calcium metabolism). Regular glass and plastic filter out UVB rays. Provide full-spectrum lighting designed for birds (replace bulbs per manufacturer recommendations, usually every 6-12 months) and/or supervised natural sunlight exposure through open windows (not through glass).

### What temperature is safe for birds?

Most companion birds do best between 65-85°F (18-29°C). Avoid sudden temperature changes, drafts, and extreme heat. Signs of overheating include panting and holding wings away from body. Cold stress signs include fluffed feathers and shivering. Different species have different temperature tolerances based on their native habitat.

### How much out-of-cage time does my bird need?

Parrots need at least 2-4 hours daily outside their cage in a safe, supervised environment. Smaller birds benefit from at least 1 hour. More is better. Bird-proof the area by removing hazards (toxic plants, electrical cords, ceiling fans, open windows/doors, other pets). Some birds can be trained to stay on play stands or designated areas.

## Special Situations

### How do I travel with my bird?

Use a secure travel carrier with good ventilation. Acclimate your bird to the carrier before travel. For car travel, secure the carrier with a seatbelt and maintain comfortable temperature. Never leave birds unattended in vehicles. For air travel, check airline policies well in advance. Bring familiar food, water, and comfort items. Consider microchipping for identification.

### How do I introduce birds to other pets?

Always supervise interactions. Keep birds caged initially while other pets are present. Gradually allow controlled exposure, rewarding calm behavior from all animals. Never leave birds unsupervised with predatory pets (cats, dogs, ferrets). Some pets may never be safe together. Prioritize the bird's safety over interspecies friendships.

### How do I care for a bird during a power outage?

Prepare emergency supplies: battery-operated heaters, insulating materials (towels, blankets), transportable cage or carrier. During outage, consolidate multiple birds in one cage for shared body heat if they get along. Cover cage with blankets, leaving air flow. Move to the warmest room. Use hand/foot warmers wrapped in towels near (not in) cage if temperature drops significantly.

### How do I help my bird during molting?

Provide extra protein and calcium during molts. Maintain consistent temperature to prevent chilling. Reduce stress and handling if the bird seems uncomfortable. Misting with room-temperature water can help with itching and dust. Expect some behavior changes during this physically demanding time. Consult a vet if molting seems abnormal (patchy, prolonged, or accompanied by lethargy).

### How do I care for a senior bird?

Adjust perch setup for easier navigation. Provide extra warmth if needed. Schedule semi-annual veterinary check-ups. Monitor weight closely. Adapt diet for changing nutritional needs (possibly softer foods). Maintain routine while accommodating reduced energy. Watch for arthritis signs and discuss pain management with your vet. Continue environmental enrichment adjusted to abilities.

### How do I recognize and manage hormonal behavior?

Seasonal hormonal behavior may include aggression, territoriality, paper shredding, regurgitation, and excessive vocalization. Manage by maintaining a consistent 10-12 hour sleep schedule, avoiding nest-like environments (boxes, dark spaces), limiting high-fat foods, and minimizing petting on back or under wings. Severe cases may require veterinary intervention.

### How do I know when it's time to say goodbye to my bird?

Consider quality of life: Is the bird able to perch comfortably? Eat and drink independently? Engage in normal behaviors? Is pain well-managed? Are there more good days than bad? Discuss options with an avian veterinarian who can provide guidance specific to your bird's condition. Some birds hide illness until very advanced stages, so veterinary assessment is crucial.
