# Fish Care FAQ

## Aquarium Setup & Maintenance

### What size aquarium should I get for beginners?

Larger tanks (20+ gallons) are actually easier for beginners as they maintain stable water parameters better than small tanks. Small fluctuations have less impact in larger volumes of water. If space is limited, a 10-gallon is the recommended minimum for most fish. Avoid bowls and tanks under 5 gallons, which are difficult to maintain and limit fish options.

### How do I cycle my new aquarium?

Cycling establishes beneficial bacteria that convert toxic ammonia to less harmful nitrates. Add an ammonia source (fish food, pure ammonia, or hardy fish) to the tank. Test water regularly for ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate. You'll see ammonia rise, then nitrite, then nitrate. The tank is cycled when ammonia and nitrite read zero while nitrate rises. This process takes 4-6 weeks.

### How often should I change aquarium water?

Perform 10-25% water changes weekly for most setups. Heavily stocked or smaller tanks may need more frequent changes. Use a gravel vacuum to remove debris from substrate during water changes. Always treat new water with a dechlorinator and match temperature to tank water. Never change 100% of the water, as this disrupts beneficial bacteria and stresses fish.

### How do I clean my aquarium without harming fish?

Regular maintenance includes partial water changes, gravel vacuuming, algae scraping, and filter media rinsing in old tank water (never tap water). Leave fish in the tank during routine cleaning. Clean decorations as needed in a bucket of old tank water. Never use soap or household cleaners on anything that contacts aquarium water.

### What water parameters should I monitor?

Essential parameters include ammonia (target: 0 ppm), nitrite (0 ppm), nitrate (<20 ppm), pH (species-dependent, usually 6.5-8.0), and temperature (species-dependent). Additional helpful parameters include GH (general hardness), KH (carbonate hardness), and TDS (total dissolved solids). Test weekly until the tank is established, then bi-weekly or monthly for stable setups.

### How do I lower ammonia levels in my tank?

Immediate actions: Perform a 50% water change, add ammonia-neutralizing products (temporary solution), reduce feeding, and remove any decaying matter. Long-term solutions: Ensure the tank is properly cycled, avoid overstocking, don't overfeed, maintain regular water changes, and check that your filter is adequately sized and functioning properly.

### What filtration system is best for my aquarium?

Choose a filter rated for at least your tank size, preferably larger. HOB (hang-on-back) filters are good for beginners and most community tanks. Canister filters offer superior filtration for larger or heavily stocked tanks. Sponge filters work well for fry, shrimp, or as supplementary filtration. Undergravel filters are less common now but can be effective when properly maintained.

### Do I need a heater in my aquarium?

Most tropical fish require consistent temperatures between 74-80°F (23-27°C), necessitating a heater. Choose a heater with 3-5 watts per gallon capacity. Only coldwater species like goldfish can thrive without heaters. Use a separate thermometer to verify temperature, as built-in heater thermostats can be inaccurate. Consider a heater guard to prevent fish burns.

### What lighting does my aquarium need?

Lighting needs depend on your setup. Fish-only tanks need 8-10 hours of moderate lighting daily. Planted tanks require specific spectrum and intensity based on plant species (low, medium, or high light plants). Most LED fixtures offer settings for different needs. Avoid placing tanks in direct sunlight, which promotes algae growth and causes temperature fluctuations.

### How do I prevent and remove algae?

Prevention: Maintain regular water changes, avoid overfeeding, keep lights on for only 8-10 hours daily, avoid direct sunlight, and ensure proper nutrient balance (especially in planted tanks). Removal: Use algae scrapers for glass/acrylic, siphon affected substrate during water changes, and consider algae-eating fish or invertebrates as part of your cleanup crew.

## Fish Selection & Compatibility

### What fish are best for beginners?

Good beginner fish include: livebearers (guppies, platies, mollies), tetras (neon, black skirt, glowlight), danios (zebra, leopard), corydoras catfish, cherry barbs, and betta fish (in appropriate setups). These species are generally hardy, adaptable to a range of water conditions, and display interesting behaviors without specialized care requirements.

### How many fish can I keep in my aquarium?

The old "inch of fish per gallon" rule is oversimplified. Consider adult size, bioload (waste production), swimming space needs, and territorial requirements. Research each species' specific needs. As a conservative guideline for community tanks, allow 1 inch of slim-bodied fish per 2 gallons, and 1 inch of deep-bodied fish per 3 gallons. Always stock gradually.

### Can different species of fish live together?

Compatibility depends on water parameter requirements, temperament, size, and swimming level. Research each species before combining. Generally, avoid mixing: aggressive with peaceful fish, large with small enough to be eaten, fast swimmers with slow, and species with vastly different water parameter needs. Community tanks work best with fish of similar size and temperament.

### How do I introduce new fish to my aquarium?

Quarantine new fish in a separate tank for 2-4 weeks to observe for disease. When ready to introduce, float the transport bag in your main tank for 15-20 minutes to equalize temperature. Add small amounts of tank water to the bag every 5 minutes to acclimate to water chemistry. Net fish and transfer to main tank, discarding transport water to prevent contamination.

### Can I keep just one fish?

Some species thrive alone, including betta fish, certain gouramis, and some dwarf cichlids. However, many fish are schooling or shoaling species that experience stress when kept alone. Research your specific species' social needs. Even solitary species benefit from appropriate tank mates of different species that occupy different areas of the aquarium.

### What fish can live with bettas?

Peaceful, non-fin-nipping species that don't resemble bettas work best. Good options include: corydoras catfish, small tetras (ember, harlequin rasboras), kuhli loaches, and small peaceful bottom dwellers. Avoid colorful or long-finned fish that might trigger aggression. Each betta has a unique personality, so monitor interactions carefully. Always have a backup plan if compatibility issues arise.

### What fish are good for small tanks (under 10 gallons)?

Limited options include: single betta fish, small groups of dwarf shrimp, a few male guppies, small groups of endlers, or a single dwarf gourami. Avoid common beginner fish like goldfish, which need much larger tanks. Small tanks require more frequent maintenance and careful monitoring of water parameters due to the limited water volume.

### Can I keep goldfish in a bowl?

No. Common goldfish can grow to 12+ inches and fancy varieties to 8+ inches, requiring a minimum of 20-30 gallons for the first fish plus 10-20 gallons for each additional fish. They produce significant waste requiring robust filtration. Bowls cannot provide adequate space, filtration, or oxygenation. Properly kept goldfish can live 10-20 years, making appropriate housing essential.

### What are good tankmates for goldfish?

Goldfish are best kept with other goldfish of similar type (fancy with fancy, common with common). They're coldwater fish with specific needs. Possible tankmates include: white cloud mountain minnows, dojo/weather loaches, and bristlenose plecos. Avoid tropical fish requiring higher temperatures and small fish that goldfish might eat. Any tankmates need ample space beyond the goldfish's requirements.

## Feeding & Nutrition

### How often should I feed my fish?

Most adult fish do well with once or twice daily feedings. Feed only what they can consume in 2-3 minutes. Fry and juvenile fish benefit from more frequent, smaller feedings (3-5 times daily). Some bottom feeders and algae eaters may graze continuously. It's better to underfeed than overfeed, as excess food pollutes water and can lead to health problems.

### What types of food should I feed my fish?

Provide a varied diet based on your fish's natural feeding habits. Options include: quality flakes or pellets as a staple, frozen foods (bloodworms, brine shrimp, daphnia), freeze-dried foods, and live foods for some species. Herbivores need vegetable matter (algae wafers, blanched vegetables). Research each species' specific dietary needs for optimal health.

### Can I feed my fish human food?

Some human foods are suitable as occasional treats: blanched vegetables (peas, zucchini, spinach, cucumber), small amounts of garlic (antibacterial properties), and unseasoned seafood for carnivores. Never feed processed, seasoned, or oily human foods. Remove uneaten portions after a few hours to prevent water contamination. These should supplement, not replace, a balanced fish diet.

### How do I know if I'm feeding my fish enough?

Healthy fish have good coloration, active behavior, and maintain appropriate weight (slightly rounded but not bloated). Underfeeding signs include aggression during feeding, weight loss, and slow growth. Overfeeding signs include leftover food, cloudy water, algae blooms, and fish obesity. Adjust portions based on observation, and remember that many fish will always appear "hungry" even when adequately fed.

### Should I feed my fish when I go on vacation?

For absences under a week, healthy adult fish can go without feeding. For longer periods, use automatic feeders (test before leaving), vacation feeding blocks (use cautiously as they can pollute water), or arrange for a reliable person to feed. Leave detailed instructions with pre-measured portions to prevent overfeeding. Perform a water change before leaving and after returning.

## Health & Disease

### How do I know if my fish is sick?

Watch for: unusual swimming patterns, loss of appetite, visible spots or growths, frayed or clamped fins, rapid gill movement, scratching against objects, color changes, bloating, or lethargy. Healthy fish have clear eyes, intact fins, good color, regular breathing, and active behavior. Early detection is crucial, so observe your fish daily during feeding.

### What is ich and how do I treat it?

Ich (Ichthyophthiriasis) is a common parasitic disease appearing as white spots resembling salt grains on fish. Treatment includes raising temperature to 86°F/30°C (if fish can tolerate it) to speed the parasite's lifecycle, and medication containing malachite green, formaldehyde, or copper. Remove carbon filtration during treatment. Complete the full treatment even if spots disappear, as the parasite has multiple life stages.

### Why is my fish staying at the top/bottom of the tank?

Top-dwelling behavior may indicate oxygen deficiency (add aeration), ammonia/nitrite poisoning (test water, do water changes), or swim bladder issues. Bottom-sitting can indicate stress, illness, or natural behavior for some species. New fish may hide initially. If accompanied by other symptoms like rapid breathing or color changes, test water parameters and observe for additional signs of illness.

### How do I quarantine new fish?

Set up a separate tank (5-10 gallons) with filter, heater, and hiding places. Use mature filter media from your main tank to establish beneficial bacteria. Keep new fish in quarantine for 2-4 weeks, observing for signs of disease. Maintain excellent water quality with frequent testing and water changes. Use separate equipment for quarantine tanks to prevent cross-contamination.

### What medications should I keep on hand for fish emergencies?

A basic fish first aid kit should include: broad-spectrum antibiotic, anti-parasitic medication, antifungal treatment, aquarium salt, and a quarantine tank setup. Research proper dosing and contraindications before use. Some medications affect beneficial bacteria or are unsafe for certain species (especially invertebrates, scaleless fish, or plants). Always identify the problem before treating.

### How do I euthanize a fish humanely?

If a fish is suffering with no hope of recovery, clove oil is the most humane method. Mix 4-5 drops with tank water in a separate container, add the fish, which will become unconscious, then after 10 minutes add 20+ more drops for humane euthanasia. Alternatively, seek veterinary assistance. Never use freezing, flushing, alcohol, or blunt trauma, which cause suffering.

## Breeding & Fry Care

### How do I know if my fish are male or female?

Identification varies by species. Common differences include: size (females often larger), fin shape (males often have longer/more elaborate fins), coloration (males often brighter), body shape (females rounder when mature), and specialized structures (like guppy gonopodium). Research your specific species for accurate sexing methods. Some species show minimal sexual dimorphism and are difficult to sex visually.

### How do I encourage my fish to breed?

Provide optimal conditions: appropriate water parameters, temperature adjustments (often slightly warmer), high-quality varied diet, suitable spawning sites (plants, caves, spawning mops), and sometimes separation and reintroduction of males and females. Research your specific species' breeding triggers and requirements. Some species need very specific conditions like seasonal temperature changes or pH adjustments.

### How do I care for fish eggs and fry?

Requirements vary by species. Many eggs and fry need separation from adults to prevent predation. Provide sponge filtration (gentle), frequent small water changes, and appropriate-sized food (infusoria, liquid fry food, newly hatched brine shrimp). Maintain stable water parameters. Some livebearers (guppies, platies) produce free-swimming fry requiring less intensive care than egg-layers.

### What do I feed baby fish?

Start with foods sized appropriately for tiny mouths: infusoria (for the smallest fry), commercially prepared liquid fry food, finely crushed flakes, newly hatched brine shrimp (excellent first food for many species), and microworms. Feed small amounts 3-5 times daily. Gradually introduce larger foods as fry grow. Clean uneaten food promptly to maintain water quality.

## Specialized Setups

### How do I set up a planted aquarium?

Choose appropriate substrate (nutrient-rich or inert with root tabs), lighting (intensity and spectrum based on plant needs), and CO2 (optional for low-light plants, beneficial for medium to high-light). Select plants based on your experience level and tank conditions. Start with easy species like Anubias, Java fern, Amazon sword, and Vallisneria. Fertilize as needed based on plant types and growth.

### What fish are good for a planted tank?

Good choices include: small tetras (neon, cardinal, ember), rasboras (harlequin, chili), dwarf corydoras, otocinclus catfish, and small gouramis. Avoid fish that dig or uproot plants (large cichlids, goldfish) or eat plants (silver dollars, some barbs). Consider shrimp and snails as algae management. Choose fish whose size and activity level suit your aquascape design.

### How do I set up a reef aquarium?

Reef tanks require specialized equipment: powerful filtration (often sump-based), protein skimmer, high-quality lighting (specific spectrum for corals), reliable heater, powerheads for water movement, and testing kits for additional parameters (calcium, alkalinity, magnesium, phosphate). Start with hardy corals (leathers, mushrooms, zoanthids) and compatible fish. Maintain extremely stable water parameters with regular testing.

### What equipment do I need for a discus tank?

Discus require large tanks (minimum 55 gallons), excellent filtration, stable high temperatures (82-86°F/28-30°C), soft acidic water (pH 6.0-7.0, low GH), and pristine water quality maintained through frequent water changes (often 50% several times weekly). Use smooth substrate and minimal decoration to facilitate cleaning. Provide high-quality varied diet including beef heart mix, bloodworms, and specialized discus pellets.

### How do I set up a biotope aquarium?

Research a specific natural habitat (Amazon basin, Lake Malawi, Southeast Asian stream, etc.). Select fish, plants, substrate, and decorations native to that region. Match water parameters to the natural environment. For example, an Amazon blackwater biotope would include tannin-stained water (from botanicals like catappa leaves or driftwood), sandy substrate, minimal plants, and compatible South American species.

## Common Problems & Solutions

### Why is my aquarium water cloudy?

White cloudiness usually indicates a bacterial bloom, common in new tanks or after major maintenance. It typically resolves as the nitrogen cycle stabilizes. Green cloudiness indicates algae bloom from excess light or nutrients. Brown cloudiness may be from stirred substrate or tannins from driftwood. Address by identifying the cause, performing water changes, ensuring proper filtration, and balancing light and nutrients.

### Why do my fish keep dying?

Common causes include: uncycled tank (test for ammonia/nitrite), poor water quality (perform regular maintenance), incompatible tankmates (research before combining species), disease (quarantine new additions), improper acclimation (introduce fish gradually), or inappropriate conditions (temperature, pH, hardness for species). Keep detailed records of water parameters and changes to identify patterns.

### How do I lower/raise pH in my aquarium?

To lower pH: Add botanicals (catappa leaves, driftwood), use RO water remineralized with appropriate products, or commercial pH reducers (use cautiously). To raise pH: Add crushed coral or limestone to the filter, use aragonite substrate, or commercial pH buffers. Make changes gradually (no more than 0.2 pH per day). Consider whether your fish truly need pH adjustment, as stability is often more important than achieving a specific value.

### Why are my live plants dying?

Common causes include: insufficient light (intensity or duration), nutrient deficiencies, CO2 limitation, improper planting technique, unsuitable substrate, algae competition, or plant-eating fish. Research each plant species' specific requirements. Start with hardy, undemanding species while learning. Consider liquid fertilizers and root tabs even in low-tech setups. Ensure plants are actually aquatic (many sold as aquarium plants are semi-aquatic or terrestrial).

### How do I deal with aggressive fish?

Options include: rearranging decorations to break sight lines and territories, adding more hiding places, ensuring appropriate school sizes for schooling species, removing the aggressor temporarily and rearranging the tank before reintroduction, or in severe cases, permanently removing the aggressor. Prevention through research on compatibility and appropriate tank size is best.

### Why are my fish gasping at the surface?

Surface gasping indicates oxygen deficiency or gill irritation. Causes include: high water temperature (decreases oxygen capacity), overcrowding, excess waste, medication side effects, or ammonia/nitrite poisoning. Immediate actions: increase aeration (air stone, pointing filter output at surface), perform water change with dechlorinated water, test ammonia/nitrite/nitrate, and reduce feeding temporarily.

### How do I get rid of snail infestations?

Prevention is easiest: quarantine plants (alum dip or potassium permanganate treatment), inspect new additions carefully, and avoid overfeeding. Control methods include: manual removal, snail traps (lettuce leaf or cucumber slice overnight), assassin snails (predatory snails that eat other snails), or chemical treatments (use cautiously as they can harm beneficial bacteria). Some fish (certain loaches, puffers) eat snails but have specific care requirements.

### Why is there a film on my water surface?

Surface film is typically protein buildup from fish waste, uneaten food, or plant matter. Address by: improving surface agitation (adjust filter output toward surface or add air stone), using a surface skimmer, or laying paper towel on the surface to remove film. Prevent by avoiding overfeeding, performing regular maintenance, and ensuring adequate filtration and surface movement.

## Advanced Topics

### What is the nitrogen cycle and why is it important?

The nitrogen cycle is the biological process where beneficial bacteria convert toxic ammonia (from fish waste, decaying matter) to nitrite (also toxic) and then to less harmful nitrate. This cycle is essential because ammonia and nitrite can kill fish even at low concentrations. Establishing this cycle ("cycling" the tank) before adding fish is crucial. Maintain the cycle through regular partial water changes and avoiding disruption to filter media.

### Should I use RO/DI water in my aquarium?

Reverse osmosis/deionized (RO/DI) water has most impurities removed and is beneficial for: sensitive species requiring specific parameters, breeding projects, discus and other soft water species, and reef tanks. However, it must be remineralized before use as it lacks essential minerals. Most community tanks with hardy fish do well with dechlorinated tap water. Test your tap water to determine if RO/DI would benefit your specific setup.

### What is the difference between hard and soft water?

Water hardness refers to dissolved mineral content, primarily calcium and magnesium. Hard water has high mineral content; soft water has low mineral content. Different fish species evolved in different water conditions: African cichlids prefer hard, alkaline water; many South American species prefer soft, acidic water. Hardness often correlates with pH stability (harder water resists pH changes). Test GH (general hardness) and KH (carbonate hardness) to determine your water's characteristics.

### How do automatic water changers work?

Automatic water change systems continuously or periodically replace small amounts of tank water with fresh, treated water. Basic systems use timers, pumps, and reservoirs of pre-treated water. Advanced systems connect directly to water supply with inline treatment (dechlorinator, temperature matching). Benefits include stable parameters and reduced maintenance time. Consider safety features to prevent flooding and ensure proper water treatment.

### What is aquascaping and how do I create an aquascape?

Aquascaping is the art of arranging aquarium elements aesthetically. Popular styles include: Nature Aquarium (Takashi Amano's balanced, natural look), Dutch (colorful plant arrangements), Iwagumi (minimalist rock formations), and biotope (replicating natural habitats). Basic principles include: focal points, rule of thirds, golden ratio, depth perception through foreground/midground/background elements, and scale. Start with quality hardscape (rocks, wood) as the foundation before adding plants.

### How do I breed difficult species?

Challenging species often require specific triggers: temperature changes simulating seasonal variations, water chemistry adjustments (pH, hardness), specialized diets, particular lighting cycles, or specific spawning substrates. Research your target species thoroughly. Dedicated breeding tanks allow precise control of conditions and protection for eggs/fry. Document successful methods as many rare species have limited breeding information available.

### What should I know about medicating a tank with plants or invertebrates?

Many medications harm invertebrates (especially copper-based treatments) and can damage beneficial bacteria or plants. Options include: treating in a separate hospital tank, using invertebrate-safe medications (research carefully), or alternative treatments like salt baths, increased temperature (for ich), or botanical remedies. Always remove chemical filtration (carbon, Purigen) during treatment, and follow with water changes and reintroduction of carbon after treatment to remove medication residue.
