# Cat Care FAQ

## Nutrition & Feeding

### How much should I feed my cat?

Adult cats typically need 20-30 calories per pound of body weight daily. An average 10-pound cat needs about 200-300 calories. Follow feeding guidelines on commercial food packaging as a starting point, then adjust based on your cat's weight, activity level, and metabolism. Indoor and neutered cats often need fewer calories.

### How many times a day should I feed my cat?

Most adult cats do well with two meals per day. Kittens under six months should be fed 3-4 times daily. Free-feeding (leaving food out all day) is not recommended for most cats as it can lead to obesity. Scheduled meals help monitor appetite and food intake, which are important health indicators.

### Is wet or dry food better for cats?

Both have advantages. Wet food provides hydration, may help prevent urinary issues, and is often more palatable. Dry food is convenient, helps with dental health, and is more economical. Many veterinarians recommend a combination of both. Cats with specific health conditions may benefit more from one type over the other.

### Do cats need special food as they age?

Yes. Senior cats (11+ years) benefit from foods formulated for their changing needs. These typically have adjusted protein levels, added antioxidants, and supplements for joint health. Senior formulas may also be more digestible and have a different calorie density to prevent weight gain while maintaining muscle mass.

### Can cats eat a vegetarian diet?

No. Cats are obligate carnivores and require nutrients found only in animal tissues, such as taurine and arachidonic acid. Without these, cats can develop serious health problems including heart disease and blindness. Commercial vegetarian cat foods with synthetic supplements exist but are controversial among veterinarians.

### What human foods are toxic to cats?

Never feed cats chocolate, caffeine, alcohol, grapes, raisins, onions, garlic, chives, xylitol (in sugar-free products), raw dough, macadamia nuts, and large amounts of tuna. Also avoid milk and dairy products as many cats are lactose intolerant and can develop digestive upset.

### What human foods are safe for cats?

Safe occasional treats include small amounts of cooked chicken, turkey, lean beef, fish (fully cooked, no bones), eggs (cooked), and certain vegetables like steamed carrots or peas. These should make up no more than 10% of a cat's diet. Always introduce new foods gradually and in small amounts.

### Should I give my cat milk?

Most adult cats are lactose intolerant and cannot properly digest milk, which can cause digestive upset including diarrhea and vomiting. If your cat enjoys milk, specially formulated lactose-free "cat milk" is available. Water should always be the primary liquid in a cat's diet.

### How can I help my overweight cat lose weight?

Weight loss should be gradual (1-2% of body weight per week). Consult your veterinarian for a safe weight reduction plan. Strategies include measured portion control, scheduled feedings, increased activity through play, puzzle feeders to slow eating, and possibly a prescription weight management diet.

## Health & Veterinary Care

### How often should my cat see a vet?

Kittens need monthly visits until 16 weeks for vaccinations, then spay/neuter at 4-6 months. Adult cats (1-10 years) should have annual check-ups. Senior cats (11+ years) benefit from semi-annual exams. Cats with chronic conditions may need more frequent visits. Always see a vet promptly for concerning symptoms.

### What vaccinations does my cat need?

Core vaccines for all cats include rabies and FVRCP (feline viral rhinotracheitis, calicivirus, and panleukopenia). Non-core vaccines like FeLV (feline leukemia virus) are recommended based on lifestyle and risk factors. Indoor-only cats generally need fewer vaccines than outdoor cats. Follow your veterinarian's recommended schedule.

### When should I spay or neuter my cat?

Most cats should be spayed/neutered around 4-6 months of age. Early spaying prevents heat cycles and related behaviors, while also eliminating the risk of uterine infections and greatly reducing mammary cancer risk. Neutering prevents spraying, roaming, and fighting in males. Some veterinarians may recommend different timing based on breed or health factors.

### How do I know if my cat is in pain?

Signs include decreased activity, hiding, hunched posture, reluctance to jump or climb, changes in litter box habits, excessive grooming or lack of grooming, aggression when touched, unusual vocalization, changes in eating or drinking habits, and altered facial expressions (squinted eyes, flattened ears). Cats often hide pain, so subtle changes can be significant.

### How do I clean my cat's ears?

Only clean the visible part of the ear with a veterinarian-approved ear cleaner and cotton ball (never cotton swabs). Most cats rarely need ear cleaning unless there's visible dirt or wax. Redness, odor, excessive scratching, or head shaking warrants a vet visit. Some cats, especially those with ear folds, may need more frequent cleaning.

### How often should I brush my cat's teeth?

Ideally daily, but a minimum of 2-3 times weekly using cat-specific toothpaste (never human toothpaste). Start gradually with a finger brush, then transition to a cat toothbrush. Professional dental cleanings are recommended annually, especially for cats prone to dental disease. Dental treats and toys can supplement but not replace brushing.

### How do I trim my cat's nails?

Use cat-specific nail clippers in good lighting. Gently press the paw pad to extend the claw, then trim just the sharp tip, avoiding the pink quick (blood vessel). Trim every 2-3 weeks, doing a few nails at a time if your cat is resistant. Provide scratching posts to naturally wear down nails between trimmings.

### What are hairballs and how can I prevent them?

Hairballs form when cats ingest fur during grooming. Prevention includes regular brushing (daily for long-haired cats), specialized "hairball formula" foods with added fiber, hairball remedies (petroleum-based gels that help hair pass through the digestive system), and ensuring adequate hydration. Frequent or large hairballs may indicate an underlying problem.

### How can I tell if my cat has fleas?

Look for excessive scratching, visible fleas or flea dirt (small black specks that turn reddish when wet), hair loss, and skin irritation, especially around the base of the tail. Use a fine-toothed flea comb to check through the fur. Even indoor cats can get fleas. Year-round prevention is recommended in most climates.

## Behavior & Training

### How do I stop my cat from scratching furniture?

Provide multiple appropriate scratching surfaces (posts, pads) with different textures and orientations. Place them near furniture being scratched. Make furniture less appealing with double-sided tape or aluminum foil. Reward using appropriate scratching surfaces with praise and treats. Trim nails regularly and consider soft nail caps as a temporary solution.

### Why is my cat urinating outside the litter box?

This can indicate medical issues (UTI, kidney disease, diabetes) or behavioral problems (stress, litter box aversion, territorial marking). Rule out medical causes with a vet visit first. Behavioral causes may be addressed by adding more litter boxes (one more than the number of cats), trying different litter types, cleaning boxes more frequently, and reducing stressors.

### How many litter boxes should I have?

The general rule is one box per cat plus one extra. For example, a household with two cats should have three litter boxes. Place boxes in different locations, not all in one area. This prevents resource guarding and ensures cats always have access to a clean, private place to eliminate.

### How do I introduce a new cat to my resident cat?

Go slowly over 1-2 weeks. Start by keeping the new cat in a separate room with its own resources. Swap scents via bedding or toys. Allow cats to see each other through a cracked door or baby gate. Once comfortable, supervise short face-to-face meetings, gradually increasing duration. Provide separate resources (food, water, litter boxes) even after introduction.

### Why does my cat knead with its paws?

Kneading (pushing paws against soft surfaces) is a comfort behavior that begins in kittenhood to stimulate milk flow from the mother. Adult cats knead when content, marking territory (scent glands in paws), or preparing a resting spot. It's a sign of happiness and security, though painful kneading can be redirected to a blanket or pad.

### How can I keep my indoor cat entertained?

Provide environmental enrichment through vertical spaces (cat trees, shelves), hiding spots, window perches, rotating toys, puzzle feeders, and daily interactive play sessions. Many cats enjoy watching nature videos or using tablet games designed for cats. Consider training sessions using clicker training and treats for mental stimulation.

### Why does my cat meow excessively?

Causes include hunger, seeking attention, stress, cognitive dysfunction in older cats, or medical issues. Siamese and related breeds are naturally more vocal. Sudden increases in vocalization warrant a vet check. Don't reward excessive meowing with attention; instead, reward quiet behavior and respond to appropriate communication.

### How do I travel with my cat?

Use a secure carrier sized appropriately for your cat. Acclimate your cat to the carrier before travel by leaving it open with comfortable bedding and treats inside. For car travel, secure the carrier with a seatbelt. Never leave a cat alone in a parked car. For longer trips, bring familiar items, food, water, portable litter box, and any medications.

### Why does my cat bring me dead animals?

This is natural hunting and teaching behavior. Cats may be bringing "gifts" or trying to teach hunting skills as they would to kittens. Even well-fed cats retain hunting instincts. To reduce hunting, keep cats indoors, use collar-mounted bells or colorful collars that warn birds, and provide ample play that mimics hunting to satisfy instincts.

## Grooming & Care

### How often should I bathe my cat?

Most cats rarely need baths as they groom themselves effectively. Exceptions include hairless breeds (weekly), cats with skin conditions, elderly cats who can't groom properly, or cats who get into something sticky or toxic. Use cat-specific shampoo and make the experience as stress-free as possible with warm water and positive reinforcement.

### How often should I brush my cat?

Short-haired cats benefit from weekly brushing, while long-haired cats need daily brushing to prevent mats and reduce hairballs. During shedding seasons (typically spring and fall), increase frequency. Regular brushing distributes skin oils, removes loose hair, and provides an opportunity to check for skin issues or parasites.

### What's the best way to deal with shedding?

Regular brushing is most effective. Use appropriate tools for your cat's coat type (slicker brushes for long hair, rubber brushes or grooming gloves for short hair). Specialized de-shedding tools can help during heavy shedding seasons. Balanced nutrition with omega fatty acids can improve coat health. Some cats benefit from professional grooming.

### How do I handle my cat's matted fur?

Minor mats can be gently worked out with fingers or a wide-toothed comb, starting at the edges. Never cut mats close to the skin as it's easy to accidentally cut the skin. Severe mats may require professional grooming. Prevent mats with regular brushing, especially in long-haired cats and areas prone to matting like the belly and behind the ears.

### How do I clean my cat's eyes?

Gently wipe away discharge with a soft, damp cloth, using a separate area for each eye to prevent cross-contamination. Work from the inner corner outward. Persistent discharge, redness, cloudiness, or squinting requires veterinary attention. Some flat-faced breeds may need more frequent eye cleaning due to tear duct issues.

## Environment & Lifestyle

### Is it better to keep cats indoors or outdoors?

Indoor cats typically live longer, healthier lives (12-18 years vs. 2-5 years for outdoor cats). They avoid risks like traffic, predators, diseases, parasites, and human cruelty. However, indoor cats need environmental enrichment to prevent boredom. Compromise options include secure outdoor enclosures (catios), leash training, or supervised outdoor time.

### How much space does a cat need?

Cats need vertical as well as horizontal space. Even in small apartments, cats can thrive if provided with climbing opportunities (cat trees, shelves), hiding spots, perches near windows, and play areas. Multiple cats need the ability to establish separate territories and escape from each other when desired.

### What plants are toxic to cats?

Common toxic plants include lilies (all parts are extremely toxic and can cause kidney failure), tulips, daffodils, azaleas, chrysanthemums, ivy, pothos, philodendron, and many holiday plants like poinsettias and mistletoe. Research any plants before bringing them into a home with cats or opt for cat-safe alternatives like spider plants or catnip.

### How do I cat-proof my home?

Secure or remove toxic plants, medications, and chemicals. Cover electrical cords or use cord protectors. Secure window screens. Remove small objects that could be swallowed. Use childproof latches on cabinets containing dangerous items. Tie up blind cords. Ensure appliances like washers and dryers are checked before use. Provide appropriate scratching surfaces.

### What temperature is safe for cats?

Cats generally do well in temperatures comfortable for humans (65-80°F/18-27°C). They can tolerate slightly higher temperatures than humans but are vulnerable to heat stroke above 90°F/32°C. Never leave cats in cars or unventilated spaces. In cold weather, provide warm bedding and shelter. Very young, elderly, or ill cats need more temperature regulation.

## Special Situations

### How do I care for a pregnant cat?

Provide high-quality kitten food for extra nutrition. Create a quiet, comfortable nesting box in a low-traffic area 2 weeks before due date. Schedule a vet visit to confirm pregnancy and check health. Watch for signs of complications during labor (straining without producing kittens, extreme distress). After birth, limit handling of kittens for the first week.

### How do I care for orphaned kittens?

Kittens under 4 weeks need kitten milk replacer (never cow's milk) fed via bottle every 2-4 hours depending on age. They cannot regulate body temperature, so provide a heating pad set on low under half of their bedding. Stimulate elimination after feeding by gently wiping the genital area with a warm, damp cloth. Seek veterinary guidance immediately.

### How do I help my senior cat stay comfortable?

Provide easily accessible food, water, and litter boxes (possibly with lower sides). Offer orthopedic bedding in warm locations. Consider ramps or steps to favorite perches. Maintain regular vet check-ups to manage age-related conditions. Groom more frequently as self-grooming may decrease. Adjust diet to senior-specific needs. Maintain gentle play and interaction.

### How do I know when it's time to say goodbye to my cat?

Consider quality of life factors: Can they enjoy favorite activities? Are they eating and maintaining weight? Are they in pain despite medication? Can they control elimination? Are there more bad days than good? A quality of life scale (such as the HHHHHMM Scale: Hurt, Hunger, Hydration, Hygiene, Happiness, Mobility, More good days than bad) and veterinary guidance can help with this difficult decision.
