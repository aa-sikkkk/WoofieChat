# Small Pets Care FAQ

## Hamsters

### What size cage does a hamster need?

Hamsters need much more space than pet stores suggest. Syrian hamsters require a minimum of 450 square inches of unbroken floor space, while dwarf species need at least 450 square inches. Bigger is always better. Traditional wire cages are often too small; large bin cages, aquariums (with mesh lids), or large modular cages are better options. Avoid cages with tubes and levels in calculating floor space.

### What bedding is safe for hamsters?

Safe beddings include paper-based products (Carefresh, Clean & Cozy), aspen wood shavings, and hemp bedding. Provide at least 6 inches depth for burrowing. Avoid pine and cedar shavings (contain harmful phenols), cotton/fiber bedding (causes intestinal blockages and limb entanglement), and scented beddings. Bedding should be spot-cleaned regularly and completely changed every 2-4 weeks depending on cage size and smell.

### How often should I handle my hamster?

New hamsters need 3-7 days to acclimate before handling attempts. Once settled, daily handling helps taming. Start with short sessions (5 minutes) in a secure, enclosed area, gradually increasing as your hamster becomes comfortable. Some hamsters never enjoy extensive handling. Respect individual temperament and never force interaction. Handle gently, supporting their body fully to prevent falls.

### What should I feed my hamster?

A high-quality hamster mix or lab blocks should form the base diet (about 2 tablespoons daily for Syrian, 1 tablespoon for dwarfs). Supplement with fresh vegetables (cucumber, broccoli, carrots, leafy greens) and occasional fruits in small amounts. Protein sources like mealworms or plain cooked chicken are beneficial 2-3 times weekly. Avoid sugary, fatty, or toxic foods (chocolate, onions, garlic, citrus).

### Why is my hamster biting the cage bars?

Bar chewing/climbing indicates stress, boredom, or insufficient space. Address by providing a larger cage, deeper bedding (minimum 6 inches), more enrichment (hideouts, tunnels, chew toys, boredom breakers), and a larger wheel (12 inches for Syrians, 8+ inches for dwarfs). Hamsters need extensive environmental enrichment and space to prevent stereotypical behaviors. Consider switching to a cage without bars.

### How do I know if my hamster is sick?

Signs include: wet tail (diarrhea), hunched posture, lethargy, loss of appetite, discharge from eyes/nose, difficulty breathing, hair loss, excessive scratching, or significant behavior changes. Hamsters hide illness effectively as a survival mechanism, so any unusual behavior warrants attention. Find an exotic pet veterinarian before emergencies occur, as not all vets treat small pets.

### Can hamsters live together?

Syrian hamsters are strictly solitary and will fight if housed together, even siblings or breeding pairs (except during brief mating). Some dwarf species (Roborovski, Campbell's, Winter White) can sometimes live in same-sex pairs/groups if introduced young and given ample space, but may still fight as they mature. Never house different hamster species together. Always have a spare cage ready in case separation becomes necessary.

### How long do hamsters live?

Syrian and Chinese hamsters typically live 2-3 years. Dwarf species (Roborovski, Campbell's, Winter White) average 1.5-2 years. Genetics, diet, environment, and veterinary care all impact lifespan. Due to their short lives, regular health monitoring is important, and any significant changes should prompt veterinary consultation.

## Guinea Pigs

### What size cage do guinea pigs need?

Guinea pigs need much more space than traditionally provided. Two guinea pigs require a minimum of 7.5 square feet (approximately 30"x36"), with 10+ square feet preferred. Each additional guinea pig needs 3-4 square feet more. Commercial cages are typically too small; C&C cages (cubes and coroplast), Midwest Guinea Habitat, or custom-built enclosures are better options. Provide hiding places for each pig.

### Do guinea pigs need companions?

Yes, guinea pigs are highly social herd animals that should not be kept alone except in rare circumstances (extreme aggression). Same-sex pairs (two females or neutered males) or mixed pairs (neutered male with females) work best. Introduce new guinea pigs carefully in neutral territory. Never house guinea pigs with other species. A lone guinea pig can become depressed and develop behavioral problems.

### What should I feed my guinea pigs?

Guinea pigs require unlimited timothy hay (alfalfa only for young/pregnant pigs), 1/8 cup of guinea pig pellets daily (without seeds or colored pieces), and 1 cup of fresh vegetables daily, particularly those high in vitamin C (bell peppers, leafy greens). Guinea pigs cannot produce vitamin C and require 10-30mg daily through diet or supplements. Provide fresh water daily in a bottle and bowl.

### How often do guinea pigs need vitamin C?

Daily. Guinea pigs cannot synthesize vitamin C and develop scurvy without it. Provide through fresh vegetables (bell peppers, kale, parsley) and/or supplements (liquid drops in water or chewable tablets). Adult guinea pigs need 10-30mg daily, pregnant/nursing females and ill pigs need more. Signs of deficiency include rough coat, lethargy, joint pain, and dental issues. Even with vegetable-rich diets, many veterinarians recommend supplementation.

### How often should I bathe my guinea pig?

Most guinea pigs only need bathing 3-4 times yearly unless they get particularly dirty or have skin conditions. Use guinea pig-specific or gentle, unscented small animal shampoo. Dry thoroughly in a warm room to prevent chilling. Long-haired breeds may need more frequent bathing and daily brushing. Spot cleaning with pet-safe wipes can address minor soiling between baths.

### Why is my guinea pig making strange noises?

Guinea pigs are vocal with distinct sounds: wheeking (high-pitched whistle for excitement/food), purring (contentment or annoyance depending on pitch), rumbling (mating behavior), chattering teeth (aggression/irritation), and whining (discomfort/protest). Concerning sounds include labored breathing, sneezing fits, or squealing in pain. Learn your guinea pigs' normal vocalizations to recognize potential problems.

### How often should guinea pigs see a vet?

Annual check-ups for healthy guinea pigs, with more frequent visits for seniors (5+ years) or those with chronic conditions. Find an exotic pet veterinarian experienced with guinea pigs, as they have specialized needs. Common health issues include respiratory infections, urinary problems, and dental disease. Immediate veterinary care is needed for: not eating/drinking for 12+ hours, difficulty breathing, diarrhea, or lethargy.

### How do I trim my guinea pig's nails?

Trim every 4-6 weeks using small animal nail clippers. Hold guinea pig securely in your lap or have someone assist. Identify the quick (pink area with blood vessels) and cut just beyond it. Have styptic powder ready in case of bleeding. If uncomfortable doing this yourself, veterinarians and some pet stores offer nail trimming services. Regular trimming prevents painful overgrowth and catching on cage materials.

## Rabbits

### What size enclosure does a rabbit need?

Rabbits need at least 8-12 square feet of enclosure space (minimum 4'x2'), plus at least 24 square feet of exercise space for several hours daily. Traditional hutches are inadequate. X-pens, modified dog crates, or custom enclosures work well. Height should allow standing on hind legs. House rabbits can free-roam once rabbit-proofed, using the enclosure only when unsupervised. More space is always better for physical and mental health.

### Should rabbits live indoors or outdoors?

Indoor living is strongly recommended. Indoor rabbits have longer lifespans (8-12 years vs 3-5 outdoors), protection from predators, parasites, and weather extremes, and more social interaction. If outdoor housing is necessary, provide predator-proof enclosures with shade, protection from rain/snow, draft prevention, and temperature management (below 80°F/27°C in summer, above 40°F/4°C in winter). Never use outdoor hutches without daily monitoring.

### What should I feed my rabbit?

A proper rabbit diet consists of: unlimited timothy hay (80% of diet), limited pellets (1/4 cup per 5 lbs body weight), and 2 cups of leafy greens per 6 lbs body weight. Alfalfa hay and pellets are only for rabbits under 7 months, pregnant, or underweight. Treats (fruits, carrots) should be limited to 1-2 tablespoons daily. Fresh water should always be available. Sudden diet changes can cause digestive upset.

### Why is my rabbit not eating?

GI stasis (slowed/stopped digestion) is a medical emergency requiring immediate veterinary care. Causes include stress, pain, improper diet, dehydration, or underlying illness. Signs include: reduced/stopped eating, smaller/no fecal pellets, lethargy, hunched posture, and grinding teeth (pain sign). While awaiting veterinary care, offer favorite greens, critical care formula, gentle belly massage, and ensure hydration. Prevention includes proper diet, exercise, and stress reduction.

### Do rabbits need to be spayed/neutered?

Yes, for health and behavioral reasons. Unspayed females have a 60-80% risk of uterine cancer by age 5. Neutering males prevents testicular cancer and reduces marking/aggression. Both procedures reduce hormonal behaviors like lunging, mounting, spraying, and destructive digging/chewing. Spay/neuter is recommended at 4-6 months by rabbit-savvy veterinarians. The procedures improve litter box habits and allow for successful bonding with other rabbits.

### How do I litter train my rabbit?

Place litter boxes in corners rabbits naturally choose for elimination. Use rabbit-safe litter (paper-based, aspen, or compressed wood pellets), never clay cat litter or cedar/pine shavings. Add hay to one side of the box, as rabbits often eat while eliminating. Clean accidents with vinegar solution without punishing the rabbit. Limit territory initially, gradually expanding as litter habits improve. Spaying/neutering significantly improves litter habits.

### Why does my rabbit thump, grunt, or lunge?

Thumping indicates fear or alarm—identify and remove the threat if possible. Grunting, lunging, or charging often indicates territorial behavior, especially in unaltered rabbits. Provide more space and enrichment, and consider spaying/neutering. Nipping or boxing with front paws can be corrective behavior toward humans or other rabbits. Learn to recognize your rabbit's body language to prevent escalation and respect their communication.

### How do I rabbit-proof my home?

Cover all electrical cords with split tubing or cord protectors. Block access to baseboards and furniture with barriers or NIC grid panels. Remove toxic plants, chemicals, and small objects that could be ingested. Provide appropriate chew toys and digging outlets. Use bitter apple spray on items that cannot be protected otherwise. Supervise initial exploration in new areas. Remember that rabbits can jump 3+ feet high and squeeze through small spaces.

### How do I clip my rabbit's nails?

Trim every 4-6 weeks using small animal nail clippers. Have someone help hold the rabbit or wrap them in a towel "bunny burrito" style, exposing one paw at a time. Identify the quick (pink area with blood vessels in light nails) and cut just beyond it. Dark nails can be more challenging—use a flashlight to locate the quick or trim small amounts gradually. Have styptic powder ready in case of bleeding.

### How do I bond two rabbits?

Bonding takes patience—from days to months depending on the rabbits. Start with side-by-side enclosures to acclimate to scents. Conduct short (5-15 minute) supervised sessions in neutral territory neither rabbit claims. Gradually increase session length as positive behaviors develop. Provide hiding spots, multiple food sources, and stress bonding experiences (car rides, unfamiliar environments). Watch for positive signs: grooming, lying together, eating together. Separate immediately if serious fighting occurs.

## Gerbils

### What size tank do gerbils need?

Gerbils need a minimum 20-gallon tank (30+ gallons preferred for pairs/trios) with a secure, ventilated lid. Aquariums or large bin cages work best, as gerbils are avid diggers and chewers that can escape wire cages. Provide at least 8-10 inches of bedding depth for tunneling. Tanks smaller than 20 gallons don't provide adequate space for exercise and natural burrowing behavior, leading to stress and stereotypical behaviors.

### Can gerbils live alone?

Gerbils are highly social and should live in same-sex pairs or small groups. Lone gerbils often become depressed, stressed, and may develop stereotypical behaviors. Introduce young gerbils (under 10 weeks) for best compatibility. The split-tank method works for older introductions. Always monitor new groups for fighting. Occasionally, a gerbil that has lost its companion may not accept a new one and may need to live alone with extra human interaction.

### What bedding is best for gerbils?

Paper-based beddings (Carefresh, Clean & Cozy) mixed with aspen shavings provide optimal tunneling stability. Provide 8-10 inches depth minimum. Avoid pine/cedar (toxic phenols), cotton/fiber beddings (cause impaction and limb entanglement), and scented products. Gerbils need to create tunnel systems as they would in their natural desert habitat. Bedding should be spot-cleaned as needed and completely changed monthly.

### What should I feed my gerbils?

A quality gerbil or hamster seed mix supplemented with a small amount of lab blocks ensures balanced nutrition. Daily portions should be about 1-2 tablespoons per gerbil. Supplement with small amounts of fresh vegetables (carrots, cucumber, bell peppers) and occasional fruits. Provide small amounts of protein (mealworms, plain cooked chicken) weekly. Sunflower seeds and nuts should be limited due to high fat content.

### Why is my gerbil losing fur?

Fur loss can indicate parasites, fungal infections, allergies to bedding, fighting with cage mates (check for scabs), barbering (excessive grooming by the gerbil or its companions due to stress or boredom), or age-related thinning. Provide more enrichment, ensure adequate space, check for wounds, and consult an exotic veterinarian if the condition persists or is accompanied by other symptoms like scratching, redness, or behavior changes.

### How do I prevent gerbils from fighting?

House gerbils in adequately sized enclosures (30+ gallons for pairs) with multiple hideouts, feeding stations, and water sources to prevent resource guarding. Introduce only young gerbils or use the split-tank method for older introductions. Watch for signs of tension: boxing, chasing, excessive squeaking. Serious fighting (drawing blood) requires immediate separation. Some individuals, particularly older males, may not be compatible despite best efforts.

## Mice

### What cage size do pet mice need?

Mice need a minimum of 288 square inches of floor space for a pair, with an additional 72 square inches per additional mouse. Tall cages with multiple levels are appreciated as mice enjoy climbing. Bar spacing should not exceed 1/4 inch to prevent escapes. Aquariums with mesh lids, bin cages, or specialized mouse cages work well. Provide multiple hideouts, climbing opportunities, and at least 3 inches of bedding for burrowing.

### Should mice be kept in groups?

Female mice are highly social and should be kept in pairs or small groups. Males typically fight when housed together after maturity and are best kept alone or neutered if housed with females. Lone female mice often become stressed, depressed, and may develop stereotypical behaviors. When introducing mice, monitor carefully for fighting and have a backup cage ready if separation becomes necessary.

### What should I feed my mice?

A quality mouse or rat block should form the base diet, supplemented with small amounts of grains, seeds, fresh vegetables, and occasional fruits. Limit fatty seeds (sunflower, pumpkin) and nuts. Adult mice eat approximately 1-2 teaspoons of food daily. Obesity is common in pet mice, so monitor body condition. Provide fresh water daily in a bottle with a sipper tube, checking regularly for clogs.

### Why is my mouse making a clicking/wheezing sound?

Respiratory sounds in mice are concerning and often indicate a respiratory infection, which can quickly become serious. Mycoplasma bacteria, common in mice, can cause chronic respiratory disease. Symptoms include labored breathing, hunched posture, reduced activity, and nasal/eye discharge. Seek veterinary care promptly, as respiratory infections require antibiotic treatment. Prevent by maintaining clean bedding, good ventilation, and avoiding cedar/pine bedding.

### How can I tame my pet mouse?

Start by sitting near the cage, talking softly so they associate your voice with safety. After several days, offer treats from your hand without attempting to grab them. Once comfortable taking treats, try brief handling sessions, scooping from below rather than grabbing from above (which mimics predator attacks). Some mice never enjoy extensive handling but will accept brief, gentle interaction. Always handle over a soft surface in case of jumps.

## Rats

### What size cage do pet rats need?

A pair of rats needs a minimum of 2 cubic feet per rat, with more being better. The Critter Nation and similar large wire cages are ideal. Bar spacing should not exceed 1/2 inch for standard rats (1/4 inch for young rats). Provide multiple levels, ramps, hammocks, and hideouts. Rats are highly active and intelligent, requiring complex environments. Inadequate space leads to obesity, muscle atrophy, and behavioral problems.

### Do rats need to live with other rats?

Yes, rats are extremely social and should never be kept alone except in rare medical circumstances. Same-sex pairs or groups work well. Females tend to remain playful and active throughout life, while males often become more laid-back with age. Introduce young rats carefully in neutral territory. A lone rat, even with human interaction, will likely become depressed and may develop abnormal behaviors.

### What should I feed my rats?

A quality lab block formulated for rats should form the base diet, ensuring balanced nutrition. Supplement with fresh vegetables, occasional fruits, and small amounts of protein (eggs, chicken, mealworms). Commercial seed mixes are typically too high in fat and allow selective eating. Adult rats need approximately 15-20 grams of lab block daily. Obesity is common in pet rats, so monitor body condition and limit treats.

### How often should rats be handled?

Daily handling and out-of-cage time are essential for tame, well-adjusted rats. Aim for at least 1 hour daily of interaction or free-roam time in a secure, rat-proofed area. Rats need mental stimulation and exercise to prevent obesity and boredom. Even well-handled rats may be skittish initially when taken from their cage; most settle quickly with regular, gentle interaction.

### Why does my rat have red discharge around its eyes/nose?

The reddish secretion, called porphyrin, is normal in small amounts but excessive production can indicate stress, respiratory issues, or other health problems. Normal grooming removes small amounts. Excessive porphyrin, especially when accompanied by sneezing, labored breathing, or lethargy, warrants veterinary attention. Causes include respiratory infections, allergies to bedding, or environmental irritants.

### How do I find a vet who treats rats?

Look for exotic pet veterinarians with specific experience treating rats. Ask local rat rescues or clubs for recommendations. Call veterinary offices directly to inquire about their rat experience and comfort level. Establish a relationship before emergencies occur. Rats have specific medication dosing requirements and anatomical considerations that not all veterinarians are familiar with.

### Why is my rat making clicking/wheezing sounds?

Respiratory sounds often indicate mycoplasma respiratory infection, common in rats. Symptoms include sneezing, labored breathing, porphyrin discharge, and reduced activity. Seek veterinary care promptly for antibiotic treatment. Chronic respiratory issues may require ongoing management. Prevent by maintaining clean bedding, good ventilation, avoiding cedar/pine bedding, and minimizing exposure to perfumes, candles, and other airborne irritants.

### How long do pet rats live?

The average lifespan is 2-3 years, with females typically developing health issues earlier than males. Genetics, diet, environment, and veterinary care all impact longevity. Common age-related issues include respiratory problems, tumors (especially mammary tumors in females), and hind leg degeneration. Regular health monitoring and prompt veterinary care for issues can improve quality of life in senior rats.

## Chinchillas

### What cage size do chinchillas need?

Chinchillas need multi-level cages with minimum dimensions of 24"x24"x36" for a single chinchilla, with more space for pairs. Provide multiple solid platforms (not wire) at various heights, as chinchillas are excellent jumpers. Wire spacing should not exceed 1"x1" to prevent escapes and injuries. Avoid plastic components which will be chewed. Quality chinchilla-specific cages or modified multi-level ferret cages work well.

### What temperature is safe for chinchillas?

Chinchillas are extremely sensitive to heat and can develop fatal heat stroke at temperatures above 75°F (24°C). Ideal temperature range is 60-70°F (15-21°C) with humidity below 50%. Never place cages in direct sunlight, near heaters, or in rooms without good air circulation. Signs of overheating include ear redness, lethargy, and rapid breathing. Provide granite or marble slabs as cooling surfaces.

### How often do chinchillas need dust baths?

Offer dust baths 2-3 times weekly for 10-15 minutes each time. Use only chinchilla-specific dust (never sand or other substitutes). Dust baths clean the dense fur, prevent oil buildup, and provide important behavioral enrichment. Some chinchillas may need more frequent baths in humid environments. Remove the dust bath after use to prevent contamination with urine or feces.

### What should I feed my chinchilla?

Chinchillas require unlimited high-quality timothy hay (80-90% of diet), small amounts of chinchilla pellets (1-2 tablespoons daily), and occasional treats. Alfalfa hay should only be given to young, pregnant, or nursing chinchillas due to high calcium content. Avoid fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds, which can cause digestive upset. Treats should be limited to chinchilla-safe dried herbs or rose hips. Fresh water should always be available.

### How much exercise do chinchillas need?

Chinchillas need daily out-of-cage exercise in a secure, chinchilla-proofed room. Aim for 30-60 minutes daily under supervision. Their cage should have multiple levels, ledges, and safe wooden items for jumping and climbing. Provide a solid-surface exercise wheel (minimum 14" diameter) for additional activity. Chinchillas are crepuscular (most active at dawn/dusk) and may be quite active in their cages during these times.

### Why is my chinchilla losing fur?

Fur slip (releasing patches of fur when stressed or handled roughly) is a defense mechanism. Barbering (chewing fur off themselves or cage mates) can indicate stress, boredom, or nutritional deficiencies. Ring bark (fur loss around the tail base) often indicates cage mate aggression. Fungal infections cause circular patches with inflammation. Consult an exotic veterinarian for persistent or concerning fur loss, especially if accompanied by skin changes or behavioral differences.

### How do I trim my chinchilla's teeth?

Chinchillas have continuously growing teeth that normally wear down through hay consumption and chewing appropriate materials. Provide unlimited timothy hay and safe chew items (apple wood, pumice stones, lava blocks). Malocclusion (misaligned teeth) requires veterinary intervention with specialized dental tools. Signs of dental problems include drooling, difficulty eating, weight loss, and reduced fecal output. Never attempt to trim teeth yourself.

### How long do chinchillas live?

With proper care, chinchillas typically live 10-15 years, with some reaching 20+ years. Their long lifespan requires significant long-term commitment. Factors affecting longevity include genetics, diet, environment, temperature management, and veterinary care. Establish a relationship with an exotic veterinarian experienced with chinchillas before health issues arise, as they have specialized care requirements.

## Hedgehogs

### What cage size do hedgehogs need?

Hedgehogs need a minimum of 4 square feet of unbroken floor space (larger is better). Wire cages with solid bottoms, large plastic-bottom cages with wire tops, or large bin cages work well. Bar spacing should not exceed 1 inch to prevent escapes. Avoid wire floors which can injure feet. Provide a solid-surface wheel (minimum 12" diameter), hideout, and appropriate bedding. Inadequate space contributes to obesity and behavioral issues.

### What temperature do hedgehogs need?

Maintain ambient temperature between 72-80°F (22-27°C). Temperatures below 70°F (21°C) can trigger hibernation attempts, which are dangerous for pet hedgehogs. Provide supplemental heating through ceramic heat emitters or space heaters with thermostats (never heating pads or heat rocks). Monitor temperature with digital thermometers placed at different cage locations. Temperature fluctuations can cause serious health problems.

### What should I feed my hedgehog?

A balanced diet includes high-quality cat food (30-35% protein, 10-15% fat) or specialized hedgehog food as the base, supplemented with insects (mealworms, crickets) for protein and enrichment. Offer small amounts of fruits and vegetables. Avoid foods toxic to hedgehogs including grapes, raisins, avocado, chocolate, and citrus. Obesity is common, so monitor portion sizes (typically 2-3 tablespoons of kibble daily) and body condition.

### Why is my hedgehog losing quills?

Normal quilling occurs in juveniles (around 6-8 weeks, 4-5 months, and 8-12 months) as baby quills are replaced with adult quills. Abnormal quill loss may indicate mites, fungal infections, stress, or nutritional deficiencies. Signs of mites include excessive scratching, dandruff-like skin flakes, and inflammation. Consult an exotic veterinarian for diagnosis and treatment. Never use over-the-counter mite treatments without veterinary guidance.

### How do I handle a defensive hedgehog?

Approach calmly and confidently. Scoop from underneath rather than reaching from above. Wear thin gloves initially if necessary. Handle daily for short periods, gradually increasing duration as the hedgehog becomes comfortable. Many hedgehogs huff, click, and raise quills initially but settle with gentle, consistent handling. Some remain somewhat defensive throughout life, especially if not socialized young.

### How often should I bathe my hedgehog?

Bathe only when necessary (typically every 4-6 weeks) using shallow, lukewarm water and unscented, mild soap specifically for small animals. Focus on the underside and feet, avoiding the face. Dry thoroughly in a warm room using towels. Excessive bathing removes natural oils and can cause dry skin. Foot baths (shallow warm water to clean feet only) can be done more frequently if needed.

### Why is my hedgehog wobbly or dragging its back legs?

Wobbly Hedgehog Syndrome (WHS) is a progressive, degenerative neurological disease causing weakness, wobbling, and eventually paralysis. No cure exists, though supportive care can maintain quality of life initially. Other causes of mobility issues include obesity, tumors, injuries, hibernation attempts, or infections. All mobility changes warrant immediate veterinary attention, as early intervention for non-WHS causes may improve outcomes.

### How do I find a vet for my hedgehog?

Locate exotic animal veterinarians with specific hedgehog experience. Contact local hedgehog rescues or clubs for recommendations. Call veterinary offices directly to inquire about their hedgehog experience and comfort level. Establish a relationship before emergencies occur. Hedgehogs have specific health needs that not all veterinarians are familiar with. Annual check-ups are recommended for preventive care.

## General Small Pet Care

### How do I find an exotic pet veterinarian?

Search for veterinarians certified in exotic companion mammal practice through the American Board of Veterinary Practitioners. Ask local exotic pet rescues, specialty pet stores, or breed clubs for recommendations. Call clinics directly to inquire about experience with your specific species. Establish a relationship before emergencies occur. Maintain a small emergency fund for veterinary care, as exotic pet treatment often costs more than cat/dog care.

### What household items are dangerous to small pets?

Common hazards include: electrical cords (chewing risk), toxic plants (research safe options), cleaning products, essential oils, candles, air fresheners, non-stick cookware fumes (contain PTFE/Teflon), cedar/pine bedding (phenols), small objects that could be swallowed, and access to other pets. Create a safe exercise area by removing these hazards. Research species-specific toxins, as sensitivity varies (e.g., chocolate is more toxic to some species than others).

### How do I keep my small pet cool in summer?

Provide ceramic tiles or granite slabs that stay naturally cool. Freeze water bottles wrapped in towels for pets to lie against. Ensure good air circulation with fans (not blowing directly on the animal). Move cages away from windows and to lower, cooler areas of the home. For heat-sensitive species (chinchillas, rabbits), air conditioning may be necessary. Know the signs of heat stress for your specific pet.

### How do I introduce children to small pets safely?

Supervise all interactions. Teach children to approach quietly, move slowly, and allow the animal to come to them when possible. Demonstrate proper support techniques specific to each species. Sit on the floor when handling to minimize fall injuries. Establish clear rules about when pets can be handled and how. Some species (hamsters, gerbils) are more fragile or nippy and may be less suitable for young children.

### What enrichment do small pets need?

All small pets need species-appropriate enrichment: foraging opportunities (hiding food, puzzle feeders), various textures to explore, tunnels, hideouts, chew items, digging substrates, and exercise equipment (wheels for appropriate species, climbing structures). Rotate toys to maintain interest. Research natural behaviors of your specific pet to provide outlets for these instincts. Environmental enrichment prevents boredom, obesity, and stereotypical behaviors.

### How do I travel with small pets?

Use secure, ventilated carriers with familiar bedding and hideouts. For longer trips, bring familiar food, water, and portable habitat components. Never leave animals in parked cars. For temperature-sensitive species, maintain appropriate temperature range during travel. Some pets (rabbits, guinea pigs) can be stressed by travel and may need veterinary-prescribed anti-anxiety medication for long journeys. Research pet-friendly accommodations in advance.

### How do I prepare my small pets for emergencies?

Create an emergency kit including: carrier, week's supply of food/bedding, water bottles, critical care formula, syringes for feeding, basic first aid supplies, and medication list. Have contact information for regular and emergency exotic veterinarians. For evacuation planning, identify pet-friendly accommodations in advance. Keep medical records accessible. Consider microchipping for larger species (rabbits, ferrets) and identification tags on carriers.

### What signs indicate my small pet needs immediate veterinary care?

Seek emergency care for: not eating/drinking for 12-24 hours (species-dependent), difficulty breathing, unusual lethargy, uncontrolled bleeding, seizures, inability to stand/walk, signs of extreme pain, prolapsed organs, or significant injuries. Many small pets hide illness effectively until critically ill, so any notable behavior change warrants attention. Establish relationship with exotic veterinarian before emergencies and know location of nearest emergency exotic vet.
